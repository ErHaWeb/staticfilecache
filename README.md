# EXT:staticfilecache

Static File Cache for TYPO3. Very flexible and very, very, very fast ;)

You have to install the extension in composer mode. If your TYPO3 installation is not in composer mode, you should change that (!!) or you could also copy-paste the extension manually.

Note: EXT:staticfilecache is a fork of EXT:nc_staticfilecache (EXT:fl_staticfilecach before) and has a lots of improvements.
