ToDo
----

- Update the documentation to the new Extension Structure (6.2/7.0 and CachingFramework changes)
- Implement crawler extension just like Kaspers staticpub extension has. The big question here is how to support crawling multiple domains. If you have any suggestions, please contact me.
- Implement backend 'context menu' item to 'cache this branch now'.
- Currently we have no TODO. If you have great innovative ideas, please let us know by posting a feauture request: https://github.com/lochmueller/staticfilecache/issues
